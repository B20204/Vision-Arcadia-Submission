This repo contains submission for vision arcadia from team NoobsLearning.

Our takes on the model developed is kept in a pretty simple stage , for instance for the sign Lang Model we have not developed the whole module that takes the image of hand only etc
the modules have some assumptions behind them like the input is a perfectly cropped out hand image etc , similarly the signLang model doesnot provide whole words as output , we have made
a simple letter by letter model , but it can be implied that keeping this has stage one , the model can be extended to give out real time word outputs. our main focus as a team was to 
implement and learn the basics out properly.
